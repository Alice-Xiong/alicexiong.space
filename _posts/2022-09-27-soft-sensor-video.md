summary: "Video summarizing the flexible tactile sensors developed at the UBC Molecular Mechatronics Lab. Using capacitive sensing principles and different geometries, these sensors can measure pressure, shear, and proximity. They can also be combined into arrays for larger surface coverage. The readout electronics are also showcased for their Bluetooth Low Energy interface, fast refresh rate, and small form factor."
