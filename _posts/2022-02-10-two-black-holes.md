summary: "Presentation given to a high school audience about LIGO and a simple model of the collision of two black holes. The energy released from the collision is estimated by calculating the Schwartzchild radius, applying Hawking's theory about black hole areas, and finding the initial and final energies of the collision. Back-of-the-envelope calculations for what laser frequencies are required for LIGO's detectors."
