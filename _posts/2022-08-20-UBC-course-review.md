summary: "Some of my PERSONAL opinions on courses I have taken at UBC. Most of the courses are part of my undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics, with electives in electrical engineering, physics, and math."

I want to emphasize that this list is in no way representative of a typical Engineering Physics student. My university education trajectory had many interesting turns, in particular the strong focus of electrical engineering and robotics in second and third year, and a sudden pivot towards theoretical physics and projects in my last two years. 

This article is started in the summer of my 4th year and updated irregularly. At this point, I probably have a much stronger love of physics and a more critical view of the engineering courses -- I hope anyone who reads this keeps in mind the bias and proceed with a grain of salt.

If a course is not listed, I probably don't have a strong opinion of it, or I just haven't gotten to discuss it yet... Some courses that are obsolete (e.g. MECH 260, ENPH 257) will be omitted.


## 1. Physics <a id="sec-phys" name="sec-phys"></a>

### PHYS 250 Introduction to Modern Physics<a id="course-PHYS250"></a>

- **Instructor:** Thomas Mathison
- **Topics Covered:** Waves, special relativity, historical events leading up to quantum mechanics, Schrodinger's equation, hydrogen atom
- **Thoughts:** This was a very disappointing class. The content could have been so interesting and inspiring, yet the instructor has chosen to fill it with equations and derivations without highlighting the actual physics. This course was also taught during robot summer and at the start of COVID online lectures -- felt like the class and the instructors were all unprepared. As the first introduction to quantum mechanics, I really hope the professor can given more conceptual problems, such as what is so special about measurement and why is probabilistic nature surprising...
- **Difficulty:** 3/5 - Relativity was hard to wrap my head around, everything after felt like plugging into formula.
- **Overall:** 2/5


### PHYS 350 Applications of Classical Mechanics<a id="course-PHYS350"></a>

- **Instructor:** Mona Berciu
- **Topics Covered:** Lagrangian mechanics, Euler-Lagrange equations, conservation laws, orbital motion
- **Thoughts:** One of the best courses I had ever taken -- and one that I am truly grateful to have as an exclusive ENPH course. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics are absolutely stunning -- I came into the course expecting to hate it like all the previous Newtonian mechanics course, but this was just beautiful. Super useful in research and projects as well. Mona is so great at explaining problems, she will sit down with you to draw diagrams and try bite-sized examples before going towards a larger problem. Also, this course uses a project as final exam and it was very practical.
- **Difficulty:** 3/5
- **Overall:** 5/5 - Practical and beautiful. Also my summer research with Mona was such a life changer.



### PHYS 402 Applications of Quantum Mechanics<a id="course-PHYS402"></a>

* **Instructor:** Robert Raussendorf
* **Topics Covered:** Hilbert space, formal description of measurement, time evolution, uncertainty principles, entanglement, superdense coding, quantum teleportation, symmetries and conservations, 
* **Thoughts:**One of the best courses I had ever taken. This course was full of interesting problems and insightful discussions with peers. The level of math and formalism was just right. And there was an equal emphasis with the methodology of solving problems and their implications. Robert has a short interlude on entanglement and applications in quantum computing, probably one of the best parts of this already amazing course. Though I did find we were a bit short on time and did not give justice to the section about symmetries and perturbation theory. Also, Robert will always answer more than what you ask, but it also makes it less intimidating to ask, in a strange way.
* **Difficulty:** 4/5 - Hard problem sets, hard material, but also the class is smart and friends tend to help you out.
* **Overall:** 5/5 - This course gave me both the tools and the confidence to start a summer research position in theoretical physics, what more can one ask for?
