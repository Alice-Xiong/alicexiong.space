summary: "Presentation slides for my undergraduate thesis defense. In this talk, I discuss the motivation, theory, algorithm, and preliminary results on developing holographic algorithms for variational time evolution simulation. Many concepts related to matrix product states, quantum circuits, and variational time evolution were discussed with diagrams and examples. Although future work is certainly required for this project to reach its full potential, we believe this work can enable simulating dynamics in 1D quantum system on NISQ computers. "
