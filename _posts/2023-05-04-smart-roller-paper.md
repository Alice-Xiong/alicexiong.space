summary: "Working with the amazing team at UBC Molecular Mechatronics lab, we developed a soft capacitive sensor array that can be wrapped on a smart roller for automatic fiber placement machines. My role on the team included theoretical calculations, readout circuit hardware development and programming, fabrication of sensors, and characterization of sensor data. This work was also published in Advanced Sensor Research -- my first ever publication!"
